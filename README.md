# d3-force-troubleshooting

## I make a lot of mistakes when coding, so this is to help me identify the problem.

* Nodes ignore force completely and appear in top left corner, overlapping.
 * You probably have duplicate links. You can have multiple links between nodes but they need unique names.
* Nodes are linked but ignore charge, so that all neighbor nodes 'collapse' and overlap with one another.
 * Unsure how to fix this.
